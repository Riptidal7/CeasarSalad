## 2. Project Proposal; 
Today, your group of five is going to work together to create one of the earliest known forms of
encryption (aka secret code), known as the Caesar Cipher. Using C# and Test Driven
Development, you'll create a program that can encrypt and decrypt text based on a "secret"
number known as the shift amount.
